 3. Your First Code Contribution (The Workflow)

Ready to contribute code? Here is the standard workflow:

1.  Fork the Repository
    Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the project page. This creates a copy of the project in your own GitHub account.

    git clone [URL_you_copied]
    cd AI-Note-Summarizer-Web-App
    

3.  Create a New Branch
    It's important to create a new branch for your changes. This keeps your work separate from the main project.
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    
    (Replace `your-branch-name` with something descriptive, like `fix-summary-bug` or `add-new-button`).

4.  Set Up Your Environment

6.  Commit and Push Your Changes
    Once you're done, save your files and add them to git:
    git add .
    git commit -m "A brief, clear message about your changes"
    git push origin your-branch-name
  

7.  Open a Pull Request
    * Go to your fork on GitHub. You should see a yellow bar that says "Compare & pull request." Click it.
    * Make sure the "base" repository is `SolutionsAI420/AI-Note-Summarizer-Web-App` and the "head" repository is your fork.
    * Add a clear title and a description of the changes you made.
    * Click "Create pull request."
